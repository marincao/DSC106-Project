    <h2>Project Write-Up</h2>
  
    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
    <p>Our goal was to create an intuitive visualization of sleep posture pressure across time using heatmaps. We chose a heatmap grid because it naturally supports spatially distributed numerical data like pressure, allowing viewers to quickly recognize patterns of intensity.</p>
    <p>We applied a sequential color gradient(YlOrRd) to encode pressure. The light yellow indicates lowest pressure levels and dark red represents the highest pressure, with in-between color gradients. This color scheme was selected for because it's bright visually and easy for viewers to spot pressure changes. We considered alternatives like blue-red diverging scales but recognizes this color combination could imply polarity because of the color difference.</p>
    <p>For the interaction content, we included a slider to control the time frame, a dropdown to switch between recordings, and a enable/disable brushing tool to manually select a region and view average pressure (or, if brushing is disabled, it will simply be a hover effect for intereaction showing data on individual grids). This design allows readers to freely explore the dataset, choosing any number of grids they want and see the average pressure for different sleep postures. During the design process, we also thought of having two sleep graphs side-by-side for comparison, but realized it could be confusing if the two recorded postures are very different. Hence we went with our current design.</p>
  
    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>We worked as a team of 3 members, splitting tasks across data loading, project checkpoint, building and refining the intereactive visualization, styling, and writeup. One member focused on rendering the heatmap, another implemented interactivity (slider, brushing), and another polished layout and legend behavior.</p>
    <p>Total time spent was approximately 20â€“25 people-hours. The most time-consuming parts were debugging brush behavior, syncing hover/brush interactions, and cleaning up layout styling for clarity and responsiveness.</p>
    <p>We collaborated via GitHub and iterated based on live feedback and testing. Our final design emphasizes usability, spatial clarity, and user control.</p>
